# CNN-PepPred
CNN-PepPred is a tool to create convolutional NN models for the discovery of patterns in peptide sets.
More information and application to peptide-MHC class II binding prediction can be found in the User's guide (users_guide.pdf).
The folder "CNN-PepPred" contains the method and the folder "IEDBdata_CV" contains the peptide sets retrived from the IEDB website.


Version history:

Version 0.1.1
Addition of the possibility to use transfer learning for training.
The User's guide has been updated accordingly and the trained models with transfer learning are available in the folder "trainedIEDBmodels_TL".
Functionalities from Version 0.0.1 remain unchanged.

Version 0.0.1 (until October 2021)
Original version.
